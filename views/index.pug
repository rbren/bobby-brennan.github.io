        h2 About me
        p.
          I'm a Software Engineer with degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Linguistics.
          I specialize in Developer Tools, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

        h2 What I'm up to
        p.
          I work at <a href="https://fairwinds.com">Fairwinds</a>, a Kubernetes enablement company,
          as VP of Product Development. I joined as the first software engineer, and wrote the first
          lines of code for Fairwinds Insights, our commercial software offering. I've since built
          a team of ten to continue growing the product, and have switched to managing full-time.
